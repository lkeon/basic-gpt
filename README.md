# basic-gpt
This repository contains a basic implementation of generative pretrained transformer (GPT). Most of the baseline code has been taken from Andrej Karpathy's [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=7) and [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/tree/master).
